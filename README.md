# Installation
Install python3, git and pipenv from your preferred sources
1. `git clone https://github.com/zfreeds/Simulation-Lab.git`
2. `cd Simulation-Lab`
3. `pipenv install` to install the project dependencies

# Running
You can start the server by running `pipenv shell` to spawn a shell inside the project and then running `python manage.py runsever`.

This can be combined into `pipenv run python manage.py runserver`

Alternatively, your IDE may have support for activating and debugging inside virtual enviroments. (VSCode Python extension does)
